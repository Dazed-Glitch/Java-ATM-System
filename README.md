# Java-ATM-System
This is a basic ATM system built in Java using Swing. It includes login/logout, PIN change, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history features. The interface supports light and dark themes, and everything is stored in memory with no external database needed. It's great for learning Java GUIs and simple logic handling.
